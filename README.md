GIF created with [LiceCap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/).

On the video 8 sections of the site can be appreciated, 2 of them being the header and the footer.
The header includes a top navigation bar with buttons to hoover over, as well as branding elements. 
The other sections are informative, educational an action based (including CTA's that can be followed by the user).
The section befor the footer is a blog preview section.

## Notes

- Section separations. Wrong positioning of sections/elements brought visual problems. Had to pay special attention to it. 
- Little knowledge on how to implement certain animations, therefore limiting the scope of the project and adhering to basics.
